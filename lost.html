  <p class="mood-tag">🌧 I don't know what I'm feeling</p>
  <h1>Not knowing is <em>okay</em><br> chaggot. You don't have to name it. You're pretty stupid, but you're not being stupid right now.</h1>
  <p class="subhead">just be here and that's enough.</p>

  <div class="card" style="--delay:0.7s">
    <h2>From me to you</h2>
    <p>Sometimes the feeling is, as you described, just a heaviness. Kind of like the fog in San Francisco rolling over the hills. Or you just feel like complete dog shit, but you can't exactly pinpoint why. I myself am notoriously bad at processing feelings, and that's completely valid. You don't have to diagnose it or label it or fix it right now.</p>
    <p>I just want you to know that you can bring that to me. Always. Even if all you can text is "I feel like shit right now but idk why." I get it, and you know that I'll always get it even if we're too stupid to understand. I like understanding the way someone feels even if I can't feel it myself. It's like a puzzle to me, so don't feel like you're burdening me. Sometimes you're very bold with annoying me, but other times you are more reserved about it. You do a good job of ragebaiting me, so I'm very patient with you. Use that to your advantage. I give you that privilege because I care about you that much.</p>

  <div class="card" style="--delay:1.0s">
    <h2>Something true</h2>
    <p>On the days when everything feels like static, that's when the small things matter most. Like the feel of your bed or sunlight through a window. I know I constantly complain about Stanford, but I feel so grateful to wake up to the sweet Californian air. It's gorgeous and I feel like I'm on a four-year vacation. Do you understand how lucky we are? It doesn't mean that we have to be happy 24/7, but I want you to try to look on the bright side. It takes practice... I used to be so negative that I would just make myself depressed. Now, as you know, I'm an optimistic nihilist, and that title serves me well.</p>
    <p>I truly believe that feeling depressed is partially choice, even if the tides are against you. Feeling lost on the other hand, is not necessarily a choice unless you wallow in negativity. Think about why exactly you feel lost, and if you don't come to a conclusion, that's alright. Trace your thoughts back to what's keeping you in this state of limbo. Find one thing that makes you happy, and embrace that as your anchor. For me, when I get overwhelmed or feel lost, I take a trip to a completely new environment. Somewhere expansive, where I can seek out an experience that I can learn something new from. That gives me a sense of freedom that contrasts our parents trying to unintentionally restrict our choices and our school from trapping us inside this small techbro bubble.</p>
    <p>You don't have to feel okay right now. Just let yourself be here, in this moment, in this body, and know that I'm thinking about you.</p>
