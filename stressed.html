  <h1>Womp womp. But don't worry. You are not <em>behind.</em></h1>
  <p class="subhead">let's slow down together just for a minute.</p>

  <div class="card" style="--delay:0.7s">
    <h2>From me to you</h2>
    <p>I've watched you handle more than literally every other person at Stanford so far. I know it has not been too long, but I see how hardworking you are. I know right now your brain is probably running through a list of everything that feels like complete shit, but just know that I literally went bald my first quarter.</p>
    <p>Can you just close the list for a second? You don't have to solve anything right now. So yeah, fuck that summer internship because you don't need it. You are one of the most impressive people I know because of how you are able to see so much in the world. That's why you are objectively in my top 3 favorite humans. So shut the fuck up for a second and breathe.</p>

    <h2>A reminder</h2>
    <p>I don't know how we did it, but we got into Stanford. We are in literal paradise — just look outside with those chinky eyes. The palm trees. The sky (which is probably sunny). The sweet air. And the beach and city are right around the corner. You are still here, and we got through every single hard week before this one. We have had so many shit days together. Do you remember the time you literally had green pus oozing out from your eyes? Or the time where you had to stay up for 2 days straight for Econ and Math? Or the time where we literally got pulled over and butt-fucked by 2 cops within the span of 2 weeks? Or what about the time where Maria laughed at you in front of everyone? Or when all of the chinks in our dorm judged you? This one is no different. You are so much more capable than the stressed version of you believes right now.</p>
    <p>I'm serious. I've seen you, and I'm not the type of person to fabricate the truth for you. You're going to be okay because I have THAT much faith in you. I would not choose to be best friends with a weak and undetermined person.</p>
