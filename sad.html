  <p class="mood-tag">😞 I'm sad</p>
  <h1>Sadness doesn't make you a failure. It means you feel things deeply, and I see no problem with that. That's what I like about you anyway.</h1>
  <p class="subhead">you're allowed to be here for a while, okay?</p>

  <div class="card" style="--delay:0.7s">
    <h2>From me to you</h2>
    <p>I wish I could be there with you. I'd make you sit down with me, probably make you eat something (NOT ARRILLAGA), and we'd just exist together because that's what I love the most with you. You wouldn't have to talk if you didn't want to. Sometimes, I like it better that way, and I know you do too.</p>
    <p>Since I can't, I want you to know: whatever is making you sad right now is real. You don't have to reframe it or fix it immediately because that's not the point of thinking through life. You can just feel it.</p>
    <p>And also: I love you chaggot, and this feeling won't stay forever. It always passes, and you always come back.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="--delay:1.0s">
    <h2>A small thing I want you to do</h2>
    <p>Put your hand on your chest and feel your heartbeat. You're here. You're still showing up. Even when it's hard, you show up — and I find that brave. I wish that you were always happy because I have spent so much of my good and bad days with you... But when you are happy, it is likely that I am happy too by association.</p>
    <p>Now: drink some water. Not because it'll fix shit, but because you deserve to be taken care of, and right now I want you to do that for yourself.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="--delay:1.1s">
    <h2>Things that are still true</h2>
    <p>The Oval still looks the same. Arillaga is still shit. Actually no, Wilbur is more shit. You are still one of the funniest, most genuine people I know. Palm Drive still exists. I still almost went bald (but I hopefully have hair now). We still have so many memories left to make. I am still here.</p>
