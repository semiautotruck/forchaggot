  <h1>Frustration means you care. You are such a passionate person, so don't let that turn you into a petty bitch.</h1>
  <p class="subhead">it's okay chaggot. let it out. i'm here.</p>

  <div class="card" style="--delay:0.7s">
    <h2>From me to you</h2>
    <p>Frustration is just care that has nowhere to go. You care so much — about doing things right, about the people around you, about your own growth. You are still sticking to what you love, and in the sea of people at this weird ass school, that's a beautiful thing. Even when you are angry, I find that inspiring because you are blazing your own path. 
    <p>We WILL succeed because we have suffered too damn much. It's like getting mad at Axel or Emmie for looking at you weird. Why do you need to care about what they think? Shake your big fat ass in front of them and show them who's boss.</p>
    <p>I know that whatever is making you angry or upset means that you genuinely care about it. Remember that first big argument we had on Valentine's day of Winter quarter? We were upset because we cared about each other. That is valid, and it makes our relationship so much stronger. Same thing with your career. You won't just give up, right? Because you care about these issues you are passionate about and you love debating them. So use this opportunity to fortify your mind and tackle your challenges. I know that you are a strong person (even if you are not strong physically).</p>
    <p>Whatever triggered this doesn't define you. You are not your worst moment or this feeling. When you feel like shit, do something about it. Go outside, eat, game, or talk to someone.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="vent-box">
    <h2>Vent box — private, just for you</h2>
    <textarea id="ventArea" placeholder="Type whatever you're feeling. It won't be saved anywhere, and not even I can see it. Just let it out."></textarea>
    <button class="clear-btn" onclick="document.getElementById('ventArea').value=''">✕ clear it</button>
    <p class="vent-note">Nothing typed here is stored or sent anywhere. This is just for you chaggot.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="--delay:1.0s">
    <h2>A reframe</h2>
    <p>What would you tell me if I came to you feeling exactly like you do right now? I think you'd be kind and patient. You wouldn't just fart and shit in my face. I think you'd remind me that one hard moment doesn't erase all the good ones.</p>
    <p>Please say that to yourself. You deserve the same grace you give others.</p>
